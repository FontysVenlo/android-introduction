## Assignment 1

* Individual deliverable, implement the following app: Based on constraint layout, this app should contain **3 rows of each 2 buttons and one image view**. If you click the first button then **same image should appear in the image view**, if you click the second button that image should change. Per row you should use different images, so in total you need 6 image resources.
More information about constraint layout you find in: [Layout information](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/constraint/ConstraintLayout)

* For more background info on recycler views  see:
[Recycler view](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview)

## Assignment 2

* Individual deliverable, implement the following app: Based on the previous discussed recycler view, create an app which **displays a list of items, each item contains a picture, 2 text views and a checkbox**. Be sure to have enough pictures, one text view should contain a person’s name, the other one some additional text.  See example, but instead of date and o/p/n mark a checkbox, which controls background colour of the item, checked is red unchecked is green.
* Recycler view uses the adapter pattern. According your Head First Design Pattern textbook this pattern comprises a client, target, adapter and adaptee. See the example discussed by A. Vogella, and indicate client, target, adapter and adaptee.
* Describe when to use a LayoutInflater, describe typical situations where you could apply layout inflaters.
