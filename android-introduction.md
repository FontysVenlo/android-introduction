<!-- s -->

## Assignment 1

* Individual deliverable, implement the following app: Based on constraint layout, this app should contain **3 rows of each 2 buttons and one image view**. If you click the first button then **same image should appear in the image view**, if you click the second button that image should change. Per row you should use different images, so in total you need 6 image resources.
More information about constraint layout you find in: [Layout information](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/constraint/ConstraintLayout)

[Android tutorial](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Android/article.html#androidstudio_starter)

Find out what a LayoutInflater is/does.
* For more background info on recycler views  see:
[Recycler view](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview)

<!-- s -->
## Assignment 2

* Individual deliverable, implement the following app: Based on the previous discussed recycler view, create an app which **displays a list of items, each item contains a picture, 2 text views and a checkbox**. Be sure to have enough pictures, one text view should contain a person‚Äôs name, the other one some additional text.  See example, but instead of date and o/p/n mark a checkbox, which controls background colour of the item, checked is red unchecked is green.<!-- s -->
* Recycler view uses the adapter pattern. According your Head First Design Pattern textbook this pattern comprises a client, target, adapter and adaptee. See the example discussed by A. Vogella, and indicate client, target, adapter and adaptee.<!-- s -->
* Describe when to use a LayoutInflater, describe typical situations where you could apply layout inflaters. <!-- s -->
* Make sure you do **all assignments from the Vogella Android tutorial!** which are 
* [Exercise first UI](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Android/article.html#exercise_first_ui_interface) 
* [Exercise add radio buttons](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Android/article.html#exercise-adding-radio-buttons) 
* [Exercise temperature converter](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Android/article.html#tutorialtemperature)

## Assignment 3

> Consume a local REST-API

<!-- s -->

### Preparation

For this assignment you will just run an easy REST-API based on the president database. This will be run locally!

<!-- s -->

For the setup, do the following steps:

* Clone: https://github.com/FontysVenlo/president-postgrest-restapi 

Start the application with:
```bash
docker-compose up

or 
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

for daemon mode.

Goto http://localhost:8080 for your swagger api documentation.

The REST-API is available via http://localhost:3000

Now you are ready.

### Test your API with Swagger

- Goto your local [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/)
- Test your API if you want:
